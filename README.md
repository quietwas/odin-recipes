# odin-recipes

This project is part of **The Odin Projectâ€™s Foundations Course** and focuses on building a basic website using **HTML**. The goal is to create a simple recipe website that includes a main index page linking to multiple individual recipe pages.

## Project Overview
The website will include:
- A homepage (`index.html`) that lists links to different recipe pages.
- Individual recipe pages with images, descriptions, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
- Navigation links for easy movement between pages.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have practiced and demonstrated the following skills:
- Structuring web pages using **semantic HTML**.
- Organizing files and directories for a small web project.
- Using **links (`<a>` tags)** for navigation between pages.
- Inserting **images** and using **lists** (`<ul>` and `<ol>`) for content formatting.
- Following a **project iteration process** to gradually build and improve a web page.
